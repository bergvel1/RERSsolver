# RERSsolver
A tool for analyzing code reachability by using a weakest precondition search over the control flow graph

### Requirements
* [Alt-Ergo Zero](http://cubicle.lri.fr/alt-ergo-zero/) must be placed in the RERSsolver directory (see Makefile for details)
* [Ocamlyices](http://micdel.fr/ocamlyices.html) should be installed and visibile through ocamlfind
